# VR-Asymmetrical-Fruit-Ninja
<p> "Asymmetrical Virtual Reality" is where player interaction is split into two channels: the desktop and the VR kit. In this project game, one player uses the desktop to control one entity and the VR player will battle the desktop player. The desktop player will throw fruits and have mobility whereas the the VR player will have no mobility, but the ability to smash the fruits and throw their only weapon at the desktop player. This project is intended to expand the interactiveness of VR, allowing both the singular VR players and those observing outside of VR to both have fun simulataneously. </p>
